		<p>In general no extra configuration is required to use Java CoG Kit. 
		However, in certain cases additional configuration might be required. 
		The Java CoG Kit configuration file is placed in $HOME/.globus/cog.properties 
		on Unix/Linux machines or %USERPROFILE%\.globus\cog.properties on Windows machines.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				<a name="trusted-certificates-location"></a>
				<h3>Trusted certificates location</h3>
				<p>Trusted certificates can be configured as described below 
				and are loaded in the specified order:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Property cacerts in configuration file cog.properties file can 
						be used to set the trusted certificates. The value of the property 
						is a list of comma-separated CA certificates or directories of 
						certificates. Example:

<pre>cacert = /home/gawor/MyCaCert.pem, /etc/grid-security/certificates/</pre>

						If a directory is specified in the list, all certificate files within 
						that directory with .0 extension will be loaded.
					</li>
					<li>
						The system property X509_CERT_DIR can be used to configured trusted 
						certificates. It is used if the cog.properties file is not found or 
						the cacert property is not set
					</li>
					<li>
						Trusted certificates can be placed in ${user.home}/.globus/certificates 
						directory. If system property is not set, this location is checked.
					</li>
					<li>
						The certificates can be placed in /etc/grid-security/certificates directory. 
						This directory is checked on Unix/Linux machines if certificates are not 
						found as described in previous steps.
					</li> 
				</ol>
				<p>If one of the above directories with certificates is found, all the 
				certificates in that directory will be loaded and used. If no directory 
				is found, JGlobus will not work.</p>
			</li>
  			<li>
  				<a name="signing-policy-location"></a>
  				<h3>Signing policy location</h3>
  				<p>Signing policies are read in from the same directory as trusted 
  				certificates. All files with the .signing_policy extension in the same 
  				directory as trusted certificates are loaded for processing. 
  				By default signing policies are required and enforced.</p>

				<p>Signing policy enforcement can be disabled by setting a system 
				property java.security.gsi.signing.policy to "no" or "false".</p>

				<p>Details on signing policy grammar support is outlined 
				<a href="http://dev.globus.org/wiki/Signing_Policy">here</a>.</p>
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				<a name="user-certificate-location"></a>
  				<h3>User certificate location</h3>
  				<p>User certificate can be configured as described below and an 
  				attempt is made to find the file in the order specified:</p>
  				<ol>
					<li>Location of the file can be specified as value of property 
					usercert in configuration file cog.properties</li>
					<li>Location of the user certificate can be set as value of 
					environment variable X509_USER_CERT. This property is used if 
					cog.properties file is not configured or the usercert property 
					is not specified in the file.</li>
					<li>The certificate can be placed in default location 
					${user.home}/.globus/usercert.pem. If none of the above configuration 
					is found, the library defaults to this location.</li> 
				</ol>
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				<a name="user-private-key-location"></a>
  				<h3>User private key location</h3>
  				<p>User private key can be configured as described below and an 
  				attempt is made to find the file in the order specified:</p>
  				<ol>
					<li>Location of the file can be specified as value of property 
					userkey in configuration file cog.properties</li>
					<li>Location of the user private key can be set as value of 
					environment variable X509_USER_KEY. This property is used if 
					cog.properties file is not configured or the userkey property 
					is not specified in the file.</li>
					<li>The private key can be placed in default location 
					${user.home}/.globus/userkey.pem. If none of the above configuration 
					is found, the library defaults to this location.<li>
				</ol> 
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				<a name="proxy-certificate-location"></a>
  				<h3>Proxy certificate location</h3>
  				<p>Proxy file can be configured as described below and an attempt 
  				is made to find the file in the order specified:</p>
  				
  				<ol>
					<li>Location of the file can be specified as value of property proxy
					in configuration file cog.properties</li>
					<li>Location of the proxy can be set as value of environment 
					variable X509_USER_PROXY. This property is used if cog.properties 
					file is not configured or the proxy property is not specified in the file.</li>
					<li>If the above configuration is not used, then the library looks for proxy
					in default location using the following rules:
						<ul>
							<li>If a UID system property is set, and running on a Unix/Linux 
							machine it returns /tmp/x509up_u${UID}.</li>
							<li>If on any other machine than Unix/Linux,it returns 
							${tempdir}/x509up_u${UID}, where tempdir is a platform-specific 
							temporary directory as indicated by the java.io.tmpdir 
							system property.</li>
							<li>If a UID system property is not set, the username will be used
							instead of the UID. That is, it returns ${tempdir}/x509up_u_${username}</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol> 
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				<a name="public-ip-address"></a>
  				<h3>Public IP address</h3>
  				<p>Sometimes, especially on machines with DHCP enabled, the local IP 
  				address of the machine might be incorrectly detected by Java or the 
  				wrong non-public IP address might be used if behind a NAT router or 
  				on VPN. To configure the public IP address used by Java CoG Kit, add 
  				the following line to the configuration file:</p>

<pre>ip=&lt;current ip&gt;</pre>

				<p>This has the same effect as setting the GLOBUS_HOSTNAME environment 
				property or Java system property.</p>
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				<a name="tcp-port-range"></a>
  				<h3>TCP port range</h3>
  				<p>Sometimes it is necessary to restrict the listening port numbers 
  				that Java CoG Toolkit will use. To set the port range in the 
  				configuration file, just add the following line:</p>

<pre>tcp.port.range=&lt;min&gt;,&lt;max&gt;</pre>

				<p>This has the same effect as setting the GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE 
				environment property or Java system property.</p>
  			</li>

            <li>
                <a name="delegationCacheLifetime"></a>
                <h3> Delegation Key Pair Cache</h3>
                <p> GSI SSL allows a client to optionally delegate its credential to the server.
                    To improve performance, the server can optionally configure a delegation key pair cache.
                    A single cache is maintained per JVM and by default no caching is done. To configure the cache,
                    a cache lifetime property as described below needs to be set to be a value greater than zero.
                    <ul>
                <li>A system property, org.globus.jglobus.delegation.cache.lifetime, set to the desired cache lifetime, in seconds.</li>
                <li>Same property as above set in COG Properties file. The system property takes precedence over the properties file.</li>
                    </ul>

                </p>
            </li>
