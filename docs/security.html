<li><h3><a name="securityComponents">Security Components </a></h3>

<p> The module includes the following security components:

<ul>
<li> MyProxy client libraries and command line client
<li> Gridmap implementation
<li> Proxy path validator 
<li> Trusted certificates, signing policy and CRL processing
<li> Command line security clients (proxy creation/deletion, certificate request, certificate information)
</ul>
</p>

<li><a name="executeExternalPrograms">Functions that execute an external program</a>

<p>Under some circumstances, the
org.globus.util.Util.setFilePermissions() and the
org.globus.util.ConfigUtil.getUID() functions execute an external
program; thus, its behavior is influenced by environment variables
such as the caller's PATH and the environment variables that control
dynamic loading. Care should be used if calling these functions from a
program that will be run as a Unix setuid program, or in any other
manner in which the owner of the Unix process does not completely
control its runtime environment. </p>

<li><a name="proxyFilePermission">Permissions of proxy files</a>

<p>Since Java does not provide an API for setting the permissions of a
file, the Java CoG Kit will attempt to execute the /bin/chmod program
in the background to set the permissions of the given file. If that
program cannot be executed for any reason or fails to execute
correctly, a proxy file might end up with incorrect file permissions
(depending on umask setting). Usually a warning will be displayed if
that occurs (especially on Windows since /bin/chmod is not supported
on that platform). </p>
