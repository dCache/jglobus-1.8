	- Improve file:// url handling
        - Fix unix scripts in the fixCommandLine thig to use ' instead of "
        - Batch and script files to check for JAVA_HOME and if set to use it
          otherwise just call java.

        - Add '/' to the end of urls (look into this)
        - Provide a generic Gass open call somewhere

        - Improve on error reporting in GASS server.
	- Implement all Gram 1.6 features (credential refresh)
        - Gass server: the support for redirected input streams? (and tail -f
